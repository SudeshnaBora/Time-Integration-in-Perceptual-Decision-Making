\section*{Cortical Micro Circuit Model}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Cortical Micro Circuit Model}

This model has been developed based on the following assumptions:-\\

1. Recurrent excitation of the neural network is largely mediated by NMDA receptors.

2. The network is dominated by recurrent inhibition.

3. The neurons receive large amount of stochastic background inputs.

The cortical micro circuit model consists of $N$ neurons with $N_{E}$ pyramidal neurons and $N_{I}$ interneurons. The pyramidal neurons constitute of 80\% of the total neuron population. The $N_{E}$ neuron population is divided into stimuli sensitive population ($fN_{E}$) and non sensitive population ($(1 - 2f)N_{E}$). The participating neurons are connected pyramid-pyramid neuron, pyramid- interneuron, interneuron-interneuron, interneuron-pyramid neurons. Both the neuron population are described by the leaky integrate and fire neuron with the membrane potential $ V(t)$ characterised as :-\\

\indent $C_{m} \frac{dV(t)}{dt} = -g_{L}(V(t) - V_{L}) - I_{syn}(t)$ \\

$C_{m}$ is the membrane capacitance, $g_{L}$ is membrane leak conductance, $V_{L}$ is resting potential, $I_{syn}(t)$ is the total synaptic current.  The $I_{syn} (t)$ has both AMPA and NMDA receptors. These external synaptic inputs send outside world stimuli and background noise to the architecture.
