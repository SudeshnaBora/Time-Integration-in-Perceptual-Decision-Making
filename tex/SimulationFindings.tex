\textbf{For each of the four subpopulations, find the variable name of the corresponding NeuronGroup.} \\

The four subpopulations are \textbf{inhib\_pop} which is the inhibitory population, \textbf{excit\_pop\_A}, \textbf{excit\_pop\_B} and \textbf{excit\_pop\_Z} which are the excitatory population. \\

\textbf{Each NeuronGroup is monitored with a PopulationRateMonitor, a SpikeMonitor, and a StateMonitor. Find the variable names for those monitors. Have a look at the Brian2 documentation if you are not familiar with the concept of monitors.}\\

For the inhibitory population, the PopulationRateMonitor, SpikeMonitor and StateMonitor is \textbf{rate\_monitor\_inhib,spike\_monitor\_inhib, voltage\_monitor\_inhib}.\\
For the excitatory populations, the PopulationRateMonitor, SpikeMonitor and StateMonitor are \textbf{rate\_monitor\_A, spike\_monitor\_A, voltage\_monitor\_A} ,  \textbf{rate\_monitor\_B, spike\_monitor\_B, voltage\_monitor\_B} and \textbf{rate\_monitor\_Z, spike\_monitor\_Z, voltage\_monitor\_Z}.\\

\textbf{Which state variable of the neurons is recorded by the StateMonitor?}\\

The voltage "v" is being recorded.
